***_Easy-to-change, faster, developer friendly next generation decentralized social media._***  

Pulsate is the next generation of **faster** and **developer-friendly** distributed SNS (and of course user-friendly). It is being developed with the goal of becoming a powerful alternative to existing distributed SNSs in the future.

Pulsate development is mainly deployed on [GitHub][github] and [Discord][discord].

Let's make Pulsate with all users and developers! ðŸ’™
